# MCP Conversation Examples

Real-world examples of using PostPost MCP with AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and others.

## Getting Started

### First Connection Test

> **You:** Show my connected social media accounts

> **Claude:** Let me check your PostPost connections.
>
> You have 3 connected accounts:
> 1. **Twitter/X** - @yourcompany (twitter-abc123)
> 2. **LinkedIn** - Your Company Page (linkedin-xyz789)
> 3. **Bluesky** - yourcompany.bsky.social (bluesky-def456)

---

## Scheduling Posts

### Schedule a Single Post

> **You:** Schedule a LinkedIn post for tomorrow at 9am saying "Excited to announce our new feature!"

> **Claude:** I'll schedule that post for you.
>
> Done! Post scheduled:
> - **Platform:** LinkedIn
> - **Time:** Tomorrow at 9:00 AM EST
> - **Content:** "Excited to announce our new feature!"
> - **Post ID:** 67a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1

### Schedule with Specific Timezone

> **You:** Schedule "Join our webinar!" to LinkedIn for March 1st at 2pm Pacific time

> **Claude:** Scheduled! The post will publish on March 1, 2026 at 2:00 PM PST (10:00 PM UTC).
>
> Post ID: 67b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2

### Post to Multiple Platforms

> **You:** Post "We're hiring senior engineers! Check our careers page" to Twitter, LinkedIn, and Bluesky right now

> **Claude:** I'll schedule that for immediate publishing. (To post immediately via MCP, I set `scheduledTime` to the current time -- the backend converts past/current times to immediate publishing.)
>
> Published successfully:
> - **Twitter:** https://twitter.com/yourcompany/status/...
> - **LinkedIn:** https://linkedin.com/feed/update/...
> - **Bluesky:** https://bsky.app/profile/...

### Create a Draft for Later

> **You:** Create a draft post for Instagram: "Behind the scenes at our office today"

> **Claude:** I can't create a draft via MCP -- the `create_post` tool requires a `scheduledTime` (it's not optional). I'll need a specific date and time to schedule this post. When would you like it published?
>
> **Limitation:** The MCP `create_post` tool requires `scheduledTime` — it is marked as required in the MCP schema, even though the REST API accepts it as optional (omitting it in REST creates a draft). Drafts cannot be created via MCP; use the [REST API](/endpoints/create-post) directly or the PostPost dashboard instead.

### Schedule a Thread

> **You:** Schedule a Twitter thread for tomorrow at 10am:
> 1. "We've been working on something big..."
> 2. "After months of development, we're ready to share..."
> 3. "Introducing our new AI-powered feature!"

> **Claude:** I'll create a scheduled thread with 3 tweets for tomorrow at 10am.
>
> Thread scheduled:
> - **Tweet 1:** "We've been working on something big..."
> - **Tweet 2:** "After months of development, we're ready to share..."
> - **Tweet 3:** "Introducing our new AI-powered feature!"
>
> Post ID: 67d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4
